This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Introduction

At, Loans R Us, a fictional loan provider, loans are given out to customers based on the votes of 3 committee members. Their process is to give all the relevant information about the loan to the members and then have each rate the likelihood that the loan will work out on a scale from 1 to 5. The company is moving towards a hybrid working arrangement and would like a tool that will allow this process to take place remotely and asynchronously. Further, the company would like to formalize the process and prevent the committee members from influencing each other. Thus, they would like this tool to be created. This project is to create a proof of concept implementation of this tool.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
